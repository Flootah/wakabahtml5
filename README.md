# wakabahtml5
A small html5 port of wakaba.swf using howler.js.  

### About

This was a small personal project of mine, since I wanted to see how I could handle audio and video in Javascript.  

This port had humble beginnings. It was not the prettiest or fastest, nor was it free of bugs. But it was _mine_.  
It's now a little cleaner and works most of the time, thanks to a little perceverance.

### Navigation

You can click or press I to show extra info, as well as a link to the original .swf.
Also you can press M to mute the music. Though, the website kinda loses its touch when you do.
